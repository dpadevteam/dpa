## 2. Proton VPN

[Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/) is a virtual private network (VPN) service that allows you to browse the Web privately by encrypting internet traffic and masking the user's IP address. Unlike other VPN providers, Proton VPN does not keep logs of users' internet activity, and offers many features such as Tor integration and strong encryption protocols.

## 3. Proton Mail

From the same company behind Proton VPN, is [Proton Mail](https://pm.me), a private encrypted mail service that allows you to send and receive emails privately and securely. It provides end-to-end encryption for both outgoing and incoming emails, so that nobody except you can read your emails, and automatically filters out potential spam and trackers that might get included in your emails. Unlike other email services, Proton Mail does not require your mobile number and does not use any of your data for other purposes.

## 4. BitWarden
