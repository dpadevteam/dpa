According to a report by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/03/22/feds-ordered-google-to-unmask-certain-youtube-users-critics-say-its-terrifying/), Google has received court orders by the US federal investigators to provide information on all users who watched specific videos that were accessed by potential criminals.

One court order seeked to identify a suspected cryptocurrency trader and launderer dubbed "elonmuskwhm", who accessed particular YouTube links of AR drone mapping software tutorials sent by undercover cops. The court order covered the  names, IP addresses, phone numbers, location, and user activity of users who accessed the links between January 1 to 8, 2023, regardless if they had a Google account or not. The YouTube links had apparently been viewed at least 30,000 times, presumably mostly by innocent civilians whose personal information were unwittingly included in the court order.
