## European legal precedents in the Philippine landscape

Recently, European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has set the legal [precedent](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/?i=001-230854) that weakening encryption can lead to indiscriminate mass surveillance and violates the human right to privacy, as [reported](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/european-court-human-rights-confirms-undermining-encryption-violates-fundamental) by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

While there is no general law or ruling regarding encryption in the Philippines, the Data Privacy Act of 2012 has mandated the "use of the strongest encryption standard recognized by the [National Privacy] Commission" in the handling of data held by the government. The Data Privacy Act clause covers a limited scope and was written under a different context, making it unequivalent in scope and function to the ECtHR ruling. However, the precedent brought by this ruling holds a potential for there to be an analogous or similar law in the Philippines.
