According to [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/privacy), privacy is:

> *the state of being free from unwanted or undue intrusion or disturbance in one's private life or affairs; freedom to be let alone.*

More simply, privacy means having control over who knows information about you and what information they know. 

For example, when you go to the bathroom, you close the door because you want to have privacy. You don't want anyone else to see you using the toilet. Similarly, you might not want strangers on the Internet to know your name, where you live, or what school you go to.

Privacy is important because it helps protect our personal information and keep us safe. If someone knows too much about us, they could use that information to harm us or steal our identity. As such, we must always be careful about who we share it with.
